### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Moises Zeleny a postdoc researcher in physics specialized on phenomenology of particle physics  :punch:.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on phenomenology of beyond the standard models, neutrino,  Higgs, and lepton flavor violation (LFV) physics. The general formulae for the form factors for LFV Higgs decays are available in my repository [OneLoopLFVHD](https://github.com/moiseszeleny/OneLoopLFVHD), a new version is in progress on [LFVXD](https://github.com/moiseszeleny/LFVXD), check the paper on [arxiv:2112.08412](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08412). Recently, I have studied the "Doublet Left-Right Symmetric Model" (DLRSM) in a minimal version. I have implemented this model in SARAH, the files for these model are available in [DLRSM](https://github.com/moiseszeleny/LFVXD) .Also, I am currently a collaborator of [spacemathproject](https://github.com/spacemathproject), I am creating the python version of SPACEMATH, give it in the repository [spacemathpy](https://github.com/spacemathproject/spacemathpy).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about particle physics, python, ubuntu, basics of git and github.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science and machine learning.

Expertise in python libraries like 
- sympy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- mpmath

Also, I am a Jupyter notebook user. 

Expertise in specialized software for HEP
 - SARAH
 - FeynCalc
 - MadGraph
 - SPheno
